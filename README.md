## Contributing

To download and build Hadoop on your local machine, you can use the following script https://gist.github.com/avaranovich/5508540#file-hadoop-sh
However, due to the a well-known issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-467, that script might not work on MacOS

If you're a MacOS user, some manual steps are requred to make the library compilable. Please follow this guide: https://github.com/forward/node-hdfs
